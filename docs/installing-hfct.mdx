# Installing HFCT Sensors

HFCT sensors are used for detecting high-frequency current pulses caused by partial discharge in electrical equipment.

## Installation Steps

1. Identify the cable or busbar to monitor.
2. Disconnect the equipment and ensure it is **completely de-energized**.
3. Attach the HFCT clamp around the conductor.
4. Connect the output to the PD analyzer.

<SafetyWarning>
Always verify the equipment is grounded and de-energized before installing HFCT clamps.
</SafetyWarning>

## Notes

- Do not install HFCTs on live systems unless youâ€™re using **hot stick tools** and proper PPE.
- Avoid routing sensor cables near high-EMI sources.
