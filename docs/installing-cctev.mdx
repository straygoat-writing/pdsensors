# Installing CC-TEV Sensors

CC-TEV sensors monitor transient earth voltage signals on switchgear or electrical enclosures.

## Installation Procedure

1. Locate the surface on the metal enclosure.
2. Clean the surface for proper contact.
3. Use magnetic or adhesive mounting based on your sensor type.
4. Connect output to your PD device.

<SafetyWarning>
